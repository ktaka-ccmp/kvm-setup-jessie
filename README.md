# kvm-setup-jessie

## What is this?
This is a setup tool for Debian jessie kvm guest virtual machines(VMs) on a Debian jessie host.
While there are libvirt compatible tools for debian, I prefere to run kvm a guest VM using simple qemu comandline.
I compile guest kernel, qemu, prepare initrd, debootstrap root file system, and run the qemu program.
That's it. All you need to run a kvm VM guest is just to run the single qemu program with appropriate command line options. It's that simple.

So here is the setup tool for that purpose.

## Usage

### How to run the setup tool

```
sudo apt-get install make aptitude git -y
git clone git@github.com:ktaka-ccmp/kvm-setup-jessie.git
sudo make all 
```

Above will install needed tools to run kvm VMs in /kvm directory. Here are short description of what the subdirectories of /kvm/ look like.

```
/kvm/
|-- SRC          directory for source download and compilation.
|-- boot         directory for guest kernels.
|-- console      directory for guest console sockets.
|-- data         directory for VM images.
|-- etc          directory for guest networks setup scripts.
|-- mnt          mount point for VM image manipulation.
|-- monitor      directory for guest monitor sockets.
|-- qemu         qemu install directory.
`-- sbin         kvm script directory.
```

###How to run VMs.

You need to become root user to run/stop/control VMs.

The following command run a VM whose host name is v001. 

```
# /kvm/sbin/kvm  create v001 
booting v001 ....
```

You can access v001 both by connecting to console socket(UNIX domain socket) or by ssh to the host.

Console connection through socket:
```
# /kvm/sbin/kvm  con v001 

Debian GNU/Linux 8 v001 ttyS0

v001 login: root

The default ID/pass for vm guest console is root/root. 
The escape sequence for socket connection is "Ctrl+]". See the "/kvm/sbin/kvm" script.

SSH:
```
root@jessie64:~# ssh v001

```

The "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" on the host will be copied to the VM template image during the setup. 
So you may be able to ssh using public key authentication. Otherwise, you need to first enable password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config through console login session.

A fixed IP addresse is assigned to a VM. The lines like the following will be added to /etc/hosts during
the setup.  

```
172.16.1.1	v001
172.16.1.2	v002
.
172.16.1.249	v249
172.16.1.250	v250
```

### How to stop VM. 

You can stop a VM either by the "poweroff" command inside the VM or sending shutdown sequence through the monitor socket. 

poweroff:
```
root@jessie64:~# ssh v001

Last login: Wed Oct 28 03:07:58 2015
root@v001:~# poweroff 
Connection to v001 closed by remote host.
Connection to v001 closed.
```

Through the monitor socket:
```
root@jessie64:~# /kvm/sbin/kvm  shutdown  v001 
QEMU 2.4.0.1 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) system_powerdown
(qemu) 
root@jessie64:~# 
```

### How to show available VMs.

The "/kvm/sbin/kvm list" command will do it.

```
root@jessie64:~# /kvm/sbin/kvm  list
id      con     mon     img
test    -       -        -
v001    -       -        -
v002    o       o        u
```

For v001, the console socket and the monitoring socket are not accesible(non existent) and the img is down(not used). Hence the VM is stopped.
For v002, the console socket and the monitoring socket are accesible(existent and not connected) and the img is up.
Hence the VM is running.

### Destroy the VM.

You can destroy VM by removing the image file after properly shutdown the VM.

```
root@jessie64:~# kvm shutdown v001
QEMU 2.4.0.1 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) system_powerdown
(qemu) 
root@jessie64:~# kvm list 
id 	con 	mon 	img
test	-	-	 -
v001	-	-	 -
```

```
root@jessie64:~# rm  /kvm/data/v001.img
```

## Memory and CPU configuration.

The default value for memory and the number of cpus are 1Gbyte and 2, respectively.
One can override these by setting the "mem" and "smp" environment variable.

Here examples of the default VM and the one with 4Gbyte memory and 4 cpus. 

```
root@jessie64:~# /kvm/sbin/kvm create v001
booting v001 ....
root@jessie64:~# ssh v001 'egrep -i memto /proc/meminfo ;egrep -i "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo'
MemTotal:        1022448 kB
physical id     : 0
physical id     : 1
```

```
root@jessie64:~# mem=4g smp=4 /kvm/sbin/kvm create v001
booting v001 ....
root@jessie64:~# ssh v001 'egrep -i memto /proc/meminfo ;egrep -i "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo'
MemTotal:        4048112 kB
physical id     : 0
physical id     : 1
physical id     : 2
physical id     : 3
```
